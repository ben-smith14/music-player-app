# music-player-app

This is an Android app that simulates the front-end design and functionality of a simple music player. As it does not interact with any sort of database of songs, a test set was manually created and added. A count down timer was then used to simulate the songs playing.

It was the third significant task assigned to us in the Android Basics Nanodegree on udacity.com. The app works correctly in both portrait and landscape mode, although this is not reflected in the initial images below.
